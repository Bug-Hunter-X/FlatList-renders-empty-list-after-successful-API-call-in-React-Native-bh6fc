# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component renders an empty list despite successfully fetching data from an API.  The issue is related to asynchronous operations and how state updates are handled.

## Problem Description

The `DataFetch` component fetches data from a JSONPlaceholder API endpoint. The API call is successful, and the data is logged to the console. However, the FlatList component remains empty.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the state updates correctly after the data is fetched and checking the structure of fetched data to match the FlatList's expectations.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to run the app on an emulator or device.

Observe that the FlatList component will display an empty list, even though data is fetched successfully.
